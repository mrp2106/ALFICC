# ALFICC - Active Learning for Improved Cashew Classification

This GitHub contains some deliverables that resulted from my Master's dissertation project. The goal was to use _Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance_ geospatial data in order to identify cashew orchards across a region of interest comprised of two parts: the country of Guinea-Bissau, and the neighboring region of the Republic of Guinea up to the _Kogon_ river.

## The goals

The available labeled data was obtained in 2021, and regards a very small number of points in the whole Region Of Interest (ROI). In this area, the manual labeling task is very costly, and thus other points to label should be chosen with care. Thus, one of the objectives falls under the scope of __Active Machine Learning:__ optimally choose a sample of unlabeled points to be labeled next, so that the models' performance can be optimally enhanced, without having to label many uninformative points.

We also want to update the Land Cover Maps with the least amount of resources needed, but taking advantage of the information we already have from 2021, which can be considered a Domain Adaptation problem.

## The repository

The scripts have been developed using __JavaScript__ (in Google Earth Engine's code editor) and __Python__.

* For the __Python__ scripts, the following packages were used:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * sklearn
  * geopandas
  * rasterio
  * rioxarray
